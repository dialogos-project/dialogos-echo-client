# DialogOS Echo Client

This is a very simple client that illustrates how to implement a [client](https://github.com/dialogos-project/dialogos/wiki/Clients) for DialogOS.

Whenever this client receives a message from DialogOS, it simply prints it to the console
and sends it back to DialogOS, where it can be received by an Input node.

Compile and run the echo client as follows:

```
./gradlew run
```
